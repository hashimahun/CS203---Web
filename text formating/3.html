    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical Battle of Midway,
    and Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and then, decisively, at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. In 1943,
    with a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy which brought about
    Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and was forced into strategic
    retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained
    its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses
    in mainland Asia in South Central China and Burma, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and captured key
    Western Pacific islands.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war in Europe concluded with an invasion of Germany by the Western Allies
    and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the
    German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and
    the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of
    Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the
    possibility of additional atomic bombings and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered on 2 September
    1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.
